<h2> Website Critique: Jami Lin - Licensed Esthetician </h2>
<h4><a href= "http://www.jamilin.com/">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        My first impression of the Jamilin.com website was that it feels very busy and difficult to read. The creator placed bright lighting effects behind the main 
        header text, I feel the creater was trying to enhance the text with this effect, but it made it harder to read. The site is also extremely colorful, which makes 
        it difficult to focus on any single element or message.
    </li>
    <li>
        The website is organized horizontally, with navigation buttons across the top of the page. I did appreciate that the subpages appear to color-coordinate with 
        their corresponding navigation buttons. However, the homepage also contains images with brief descriptions that link to the same pages already accessible 
        through the top navigation buttons. This feels redundant and does not add much value to the overall flow of information.
    </li>
    <li>
        The overall structure of the website is confusing because there is so much happening at once. There are numerous images, blocks of text, bright colors, and 
        lighting effects that compete for attention. If the site were simplified and more restrained visually, it would be much easier to navigate and understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        The images on the site do not enhance the layout or user experience. Most of the images are repeated photos of the website owner’s face, which do 
        not add useful context. Since she is an esthetician, the site would be better served by including before-and-after photos of clients or testimonials that 
        demonstrate her services. Additionally, the color scheme is very distracting and makes it difficult to focus on the content. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Despite the large number of images and graphics, the homepage loads surprisingly fast. It took approximately 3-5 seconds to load, which I believe is reasonable
        given the amount of visual content on the page.
    <li>
        Overall, the size of the text is readable, but the background lighting behind the banner text blurs the lettering and makes it look fuzzy. Some buttons use dark
        blue backgrounds with bright yellow text, which is also difficult to read. The Chakra & Color Triumphs page uses too many colors at once, making the page 
        overwhelming and discouraging users to stay. The Galactic Spirits page uses text that is much larger than the rest of the site, which makes it feel as though the 
        page is accidentally zoomed in and requires excessive scrolling. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The homepage does include a navigation bar; however, many links open in new browser tabs. This causes the user to constantly switch between tabs while navigating
        the site, which feels inconvenient and disruptive to the people trying to navigate the site.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each page has its own color scheme, and those schemes remain consistent within individual pages. However, the overall look and feel changes significantly from 
        page to page. The design reminds me of a 1990s infomercial, which makes the site feel dated and inconsistent as a whole.
    </li>
    <li>
         The website actually appears cleaner and less cluttered on a smaller screen. The site prompts users to rotate their phone horizontally for a better 
         experience, I disagree with that suggestion. In portrait mode, the site feels less busy and easier to navigate.
    </li>
    <li>
        The site offers an unusually wide range of services related to skincare and spiritual wellness. However, these offerings feel scattered and unorganized. 
        It appears that new pages are added as new services are learned, without considering the overall structure or flow of the website. I feel that consolidating 
        similar services would drastically improve both usability and the professionalism of the site.
