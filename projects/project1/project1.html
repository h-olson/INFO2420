<h2> Questions</h2>
<ol>
	<li> What was your first impression of this site?</li>
	<li> How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
		on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?) </li>
	<li> Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why? </li>
	<li> Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
		it? Why? </li>
	<li> How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
			reasonable? </li>
	<li> Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
		image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site? </li>
	<li> Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
	navigation well done? </li>
	<li> Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
		the pages?</li>
	<li> How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)? </li>
	<li> What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done? </li>

<a href="https://www.jamilin.com" target ="_blank" /a><h2>JL Home Evaluation</h2>

<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this website is that it is super busy. The title of the page has highlighter colors that dont 
			seem to match what she is trying to sell.</li>
			
	<li>The organization on this website seems to be very chaotic. It almost seems like each section that she has 
		displayed on her website should be a different website altogether. She has "Galactic Spirit" and then another 
		one that is labled "interior design". The only thing that I see that links all of these pages together is that it
		has the same lady as the owner.</li>
	<li>The site structure is confusing because I do not see how the other pages are related. </li>
	<li>the multi-media destracts from the overall page. There are so many pictures on the page and I don't understand 
		how they relate to what she is advertising.</li>
	<li>The home page loaded really quick, which I was really suprised by since she has so many graphics and YouTube links
		that I thought it would be very slow.</li>
	<li>Text, Color, and size all seemed to be distrating to me. The background clolors on the "Chakra &Color Triumphs"
		had a very bright background which made the small text very hard to read.</li>
	<li>Yes, it had a navigation bar that would have drop downs once you hovered over the word, and they seem to function fine.
	<li>Yes, the color sceme seemed to be crazy and hard to look at through out the website. It was consistantly bad.</li>
	<li>When loading the website to my phone, it immidately tells me that I should switch to "landscape mode", I don't find 
		that very professional and that seems to be a work around.</li>
	<li>The entire website is unusual. I don't feel like I would have ever purposly went to this website on my everyday
		scrolling. She does seem to have everything catagorized into its own unique place. However, I cant tell if she 
		wants to tell my astrological signs or sell me skin cream.</li>
